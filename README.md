# Week 9

In this weekends, our group started writing Spring 2023 Team#1 Progress Report. Through class study and discussion, we determined the Problem Statement, Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Validation.

This statement of work details the work items for Twin-Screw Amphibious Robot, assigned to Team 1 as part of the requirements for MECE 4340: ME Capstone design for the 2021-2022 school year.
With industrialization, there is an increasing demand for amphibious robots. The aim of this project is to address the shortcomings of amphibious robots currently on the market, and to design an efficient, economical, and easy-to-maintain amphibious robot for specific environments such as swamps and wetlands.
Currently there are many researches on amphibious robots, but very few of them can really be put into industrialized production and practicality. Although the snake-shaped amphibious robot is powerful, its mechanical structure is very complicated, and the production cost is very expensive, and it is not easy to repair and maintain, which is not conducive to the promotion of the market. Legged amphibious robots currently have a lot of research, but most of them are restricted to be used in specific environments, this kind of amphibious robots has a strong ability to cross obstacles, but its movement performance in the water is very poor, this fatal disadvantage is also not conducive to its popularization and application in the market. According to the search, most of the current types of underwater robots are concentrated in duck Pu type and crawler type, propeller drive is rare, so this topic is very innovative.
The contemporary industrial landscape is witnessing a growing demand for amphibious robots that can operate in diverse terrains, particularly swamps and wetlands. The primary aim of our project is to address the inadequacies of current amphibious robots available in the market and to engineer an innovative solution that is efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain.
Presently, there is a wealth of research on amphibious robots, yet only a scant few of these innovations have transitioned into industrialized production and practical applications. For instance, snake-shaped amphibious robots, while powerful, present intricate mechanical structures, exorbitant production costs, and maintenance challenges, thus hindering market adoption.
Legged amphibious robots, on the other hand, have received substantial research attention; however, many are designed for specific environments, limiting their practicality. They excel at overcoming obstacles but often underperform in water, hampering their broad applicability.
Notably, our research indicates that the majority of current underwater robots are concentrated in duck-bill and crawler-type designs, with propeller-driven mechanisms being relatively rare. This finding underscores the innovative nature of our project.

**Statement of Work:**

The Chasing-Tide-and-Dream team, designated as Team #1, will 	work on the design 	and development of a twin-screw amphibious robot, focusing on the 	creation of a 	physical working prototype, an advanced conceptual design with 	simulation verification, a comprehensive feasibility study, detailed schematics of design components and assembly, and a robust battery energy management system.

**Deliverables:**

**Physical Working Prototype:** The central deliverable, a fully functional 	twin-screw 	amphibious robot, will be constructed and tested to demonstrate 	its capabilities in 		real-world environments. This prototype will serve as a tangible 	embodiment of our 	design.

**Conceptual Design with Simulation Verification:** A detailed conceptual design report 	will be generated, incorporating simulations and analyses that validate the effectiveness 	and performance of our robot's twin-screw mechanism, autopilot system, and energy 		management.

**Feasibility Study:** A comprehensive feasibility study will be conducted, evaluating the 	robot's potential for deployment in various scenarios, including swamps and wetlands. 	The study will consider technical, economic, and practical aspects.

**Schematics of Design Components and Assembly:** Detailed schematics and assembly 	instructions for our twin-screw amphibious robot will be provided. These documents will 	serve as a guide for constructing additional robots or making modifications.

**Battery Energy Management System:** The development of a high-efficiency, long-life 	battery system will be a crucial part of our project. Detailed specifications, schematics, 	and performance evaluations will be included in this deliverable.

These deliverables are intended to provide our clients and stakeholders with a comprehensive set of resources and solutions. They will include both tangible physical results and documentation to ensure the successful transfer and implementation of our twin-screw amphibious robot design in various applications.

**Validations:**

The validation plan for the Twin-Screw Amphibious Robot project is designed to methodically assess the robot's functionality and performance against a set of specific criteria. Our evaluation process includes quantitative and qualitative measures to grade the robot’s efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability in simulated and real-world environments.

**Physical Measurements:**

**Mobility and Navigation:**

**Test:** Obstacle course navigation

**Measurements:** Time to completion, number of commands needed, number of 	obstacles 	successfully avoided.

**Criteria:** The robot must complete a standardized obstacle course within a set time 	frame 	and with a minimum number of navigational commands.

**Battery Efficiency:**

**Test:** Continuous operation under load

**Measurements:** Battery life (duration of operation), voltage drop over time, 	temperature 	increase.

**Criteria:** Battery must sustain operational capacity for a minimum specified duration 	under a constant load, with temperature thresholds not exceeded.

**Waterproof Integrity:**

**Test:** Submersion test in controlled environment

**Measurements:** Moisture penetration, component failure.

**Criteria:** The robot must withstand full submersion without moisture penetration or 	failure of any components for a set period.

**Load Capacity:**

**Test:** Weight carrying test

**Measurements:** Maximum load carried, impact on maneuverability.

**Criteria:** The robot must carry a specified maximum weight while maintaining basic 	maneuverability.

**Process for Criteria Measurement:**

Each physical measurement will be taken using precision instruments to ensure accuracy. The obstacle course for navigation will be standardized, with time and command count logged by an automated system. For battery efficiency, we will utilize voltage and current sensors to monitor battery status, with thermal cameras to measure temperature variations. Waterproof integrity will be evaluated in a controlled water tank equipped with moisture sensors inside the robot’s compartments. Load capacity will be measured by incrementally adding weight to the robot and evaluating its movement using motion capture technology.

**Validation Grading:**

Our validation plan incorporates a grading scale to quantify how well the robot meets the set criteria:

    A (Excellent): Exceeds all criteria with high margins.
  
    B (Good): Meets all criteria satisfactorily with acceptable margins.
  
    C (Fair): Meets the minimum criteria with no margins.
  
    D (Poor): Fails to meet the minimum criteria.

For example, if the robot completes the navigation test with extra time to spare, it would receive an ‘A’ for that test, whereas meeting the exact time would be a ‘B.’

Through this comprehensive validation plan, our team aims not only to demonstrate the functionality of the Twin-Screw Amphibious Robot but also to precisely evaluate its performance capabilities. The final validation report will include detailed results of each test, providing clear evidence of the robot's operational status and areas for improvement.
